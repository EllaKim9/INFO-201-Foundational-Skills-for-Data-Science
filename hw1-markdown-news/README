# Desertification

**Desertification** is the change of fertile land becoming desert-like and unusable. The causes are very wide, inlcuding global warming, urbanization and _overpopulation_, deforestation, and overgrazing. _Although_ this is not a serious issue in the Pacific Northwest, it is a issue world-wide as there is an **increase** in the total percentage of arid land globally. This is an issue because societies and settlements in those areas will _not_ get sufficient nutrients from plantlife as they need.

- [Migration](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-34790661) is one of the only immediate solutions for society.
